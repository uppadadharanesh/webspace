         <p>In the Mahabharata War, Arjuna was a key warrior from the Pandava side and killed many warriors including his own elder brother Karna unknowingly and his grandfather Bhishma. Before the beginning of the war, his mentor, Krishna, gave him the supreme knowledge of Bhagavad Gita to overcome his moral dilemmas.[1]

            Arjuna was the son of Kunti-the wife of Kuru King Pandu-and the god Indra, who fathered him due to Pandu's inability to bear children. Arjuna excelled in archery from an early age and enjoyed the favour of his preceptor, Drona. Arjuna is depicted as a skilled archer and a key antagonist to Karna from the epic, winning the hands of Draupadi, who became the common wife of the Pandavas. Arjuna is twice exiled, first for breaking a pact with his brothers; and secondly together with them when his oldest brother was tricked into gambling away the throne. During the first exile Arjuna married Ulupi, Chitrāngadā and Subhadra. From his four wives, Arjuna had four sons, one from each wife — Shrutakarma, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu. During his second exile, Arjuna gained many celestial weapons. Despite being a warrior, Arjuna was also skilled in music and dance. At the end of the epic, Pandavas, accompanied by Draupadi, retired to the Himalayas,when everyone slowly died and came into heaven, including Arjuna.
